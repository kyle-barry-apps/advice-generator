# Advice Generator App

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

## Overview

This is a simple, mobile-first advice generator app. Its function is to provide a new random piece of advice when the green button is clicked. For that, I'm using this Advice Slip API enpoint: https://api.adviceslip.com/advice
